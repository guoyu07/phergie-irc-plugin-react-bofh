## Community

The Phergie team believes heavily in the [PHP Mentoring](http://www.phpmentoring) project.
We believe open source projects should be welcoming to newcomers and veteran contributors alike.
We all actively work to provide a positive collaborative environment and to foster learning.

## Project Breakdown

The Phergie project is broken into different repositories for parts of the application.
The core bot is in this repo. Plugins are in their own repositories.

The Phergie team maintains many plugins under the Phergie organization while other contributors maintain their own plugins.

## Code Style

We have adopted [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) as the primary style guide.

We have a `.php_cs` configuration file for [php-cs-fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer)

We have also established a few style guidelines we strive for:

* Four space indention
* Methods, Properties, and Variables should be camelCase
* Short array syntax
* K&R braces (including elseif/else)
* Chained method calls should be indented
* See [Our Style Discussion](https://github.com/phergie/phergie-irc-bot-react/issues/20) For more.
